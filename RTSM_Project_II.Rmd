```

To analyze the daily returns of Somany Ceramics stock from 2017-04-01 to
2022-03-31. Extracted the adjusted closing prices of Somany Ceramics
stock, performed ADF Test. Also, stock returns calculated using log
returns method. Performed ADF test on Stock_ret too.

# Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test for Stationarity with Stock Data

adf_test_stk_price = adf.test(stock_price); adf_test_stk_price  # Inference : Stock price Time-Series is Non-Stationary

adf_test_stk_ret = adf.test(stock_ret); adf_test_stk_ret # Inference : Stock Difference Time-Series is Stationary
```

**Objective**: To conduct an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for
stationarity on the daily returns of stock and Stock Price.

**Analysis**: Performed the ADF test using the 'adf.test' function and
obtained results.

**Result:** The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on stock
price yields the following results: - Dickey-Fuller = -0.78302, Lag
order = 10, p-value = 0.9631 alternative hypothesis: stationary

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on stock returns
yields the following results: - Dickey-Fuller = -9.6895, Lag order = 10,
p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary

**Implication:** The ADF test suggests that the stock returns are likely
stationary. The small p-value (0.01) indicates sufficient evidence
against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. Therefore, we have
reason to believe that the stock returns exhibit stationarity while
stock price doesn't, which is important for certain time series
analyses.

# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation - Stock Data (H0: No Autocorrelation)
# *********************************************** 

lb_test_stk_ret = Box.test(stock_ret); lb_test_stk_ret # Inference : Stock Difference (Stationary) Time-Series is Autocorrelated

# Autocorrelation Function (ACF) | Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)
# *****************************************************************************

pacf(stock_price) # PACF of Stock Price

acf(stock_ret) # ACF of Stock Return (Stationary) Series
pacf(stock_ret) # PACF of Stock Return (Stationary) Series
```

**Objective:** To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the
stock returns.

**Analysis:** Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function
and obtained results.

**Result:** The Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on stock returns
yields the following results: X-squared = 15.771, df = 1, p-value =
7.148e-05

**Implication:** The Ljung-Box test indicates significant
autocorrelation in the stock returns. The small p-value (\< 7.148e-05)
suggests evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

Action Step: Given the presence of autocorrelation, it may be advisable
to consider an autoARIMA model for time series forecasting. AutoARIMA
can help in automatically selecting an appropriate ARIMA model with
differencing to account for the observed autocorrelation.

```{r}
# Auto ARIMA on Stock Return
arma_pq_stk_ret = auto.arima(stock_ret); arma_pq_stk_ret

# Auto ARIMA on Stock Price
arma_pq_stk = auto.arima(stock_price); arma_pq_stk
```

**Objective:** To perform autoARIMA modeling on the stock returns and
stock price

**Analysis:** Used the 'auto.arima' function to automatically select the
ARIMA model for both returns and prices.

**Results:** For stock returns ('stock_ret'): The autoARIMA model
suggests an ARIMA(1,1,5) with non zero mean. Coefficients: - AR: ar1 -
MA: ma1 to ma5 - sigma\^2 = 0.0007901: log likelihood = 2653.49
AIC=-5292.98 AICc=-5292.89 BIC=-5257.17

For Adjusted Closing Prices ('stock_price'): The autoARIMA model
suggests an ARIMA(2,1,2) with a non-zero mean. Coefficients: - AR: ar1
to ar2 - MA: ma1 to ma2 - Mean: mean term - sigma\^2 = 136.4: log
likelihood = -4778.26 AIC=9566.52 AICc=9566.57 BIC=9592.11

y(t)=c+(−0.4205)∗y(t−1)−(−0.4677)∗e(t−1)−(−0.3902)∗e(t−2)−(−0.1162)∗e(t−3)−(−0.0908)∗e(t−4)+0.0878∗e(t−5)+e(t)

**Implication:** The autoARIMA models provide a statistical framework to
capture the underlying patterns in both stock returns and stock price.
These models can be used for forecasting future values, and the AIC,
AICc, and BIC values help in model comparison.

Note: The log likelihood is positive, indicating a good fit of the model
to the data. The information criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC) are relatively
low, suggesting a good balance between model fit and complexity.

# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation - Model Residuals(H0: No Autocorrelation)
# ****************************************************
lb_test_arma_pq_stk_ret = Box.test(arma_pq_stk_ret$residuals); lb_test_arma_pq_stk_ret

```

**Objective:** To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the
arima residuals.

**Analysis:** Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function
and obtained results.

**Result:** The Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on arima residual
yields the following results: X-squared = 0.0047404, df = 1, p-value =
0.9451

It indicates no significant autocorrelation in the residuals of the
ARIMA(1, 1, 5) model residual. The high p-value (0.9451) suggests that
there is no evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

plot(stock_ret_fpq)

stock_fpq = forecast(arma_pq_stk, h = 40)
plot(stock_fpq)
```

**Objective:** To fit an ARIMA(1, 1, 5) model to the stock returns &
price and generate forecasts. Analysis: Used the 'arima' function to fit
the ARIMA model and the 'forecast' function to generate forecasts.

**Results:** ARIMA Model (1, 1, 5): Coefficients: - AR: ar1 - MA: ma1 to
ma2 - Intercept term - sigma\^2 = 0.0007901: log likelihood = 2653.49
AIC=-5292.98 AICc=-5292.89 BIC=-5257.17

y(t)=c+(−0.4205)∗y(t−1)−(−0.4677)∗e(t−1)−(−0.3902)∗e(t−2)−(−0.1162)∗e(t−3)−(−0.0908)∗e(t−4)+0.0878∗e(t−5)+e(t)

**Plot:** The plot displays the original time series of stock returns
along with the forecast values.

**Implication:** The ARIMA(1, 1, 5) model is fitted to the historical
stock returns, providing insights into the underlying patterns. The
generated forecast can be used for future predictions, and the plot
visually represents the model's performance.

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: Box Test 
stk_ret_sq = arma_pq_stk_ret$residuals^2 # Return Variance (Since Mean Returns is approx. 0)
plot(stk_ret_sq)
stk_ret_sq_box_test = Box.test(stk_ret_sq, lag = 10) # H0: Return Variance Series is Not Serially Correlated
stk_ret_sq_box_test # Inference : Return Variance Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
stk_ret_arch_test = ArchTest(arma_pq_stk_ret$residuals^2, lags = 10) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)
```

**Objective:** To test for volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity
in the arima residuals.

**Analysis:** Conducted Box test and ARCH test on the squared residuals
to assess the presence of volatility clustering.

**Results:**

1.  Box Test for Volatility Clustering:
    -   X-squared statistic: 66.742
    -   Degrees of freedom: 10
    -   p-value: 1.879e-10 Thus, the test indicates significant evidence
        against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the return variance
        series exhibits volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity
2.  ARCH Test for Volatility Clustering:
    -   Chi-squared statistic: 5.3099
    -   Degrees of freedom: 10
    -   p-value: 0.8695 Thus, The ARCH test provides no significant
        evidence against the null hypothesis. It confirms the presence
        of no ARCH effects in the return series.

**Implication:** The results from both tests suggest the variation and
lacks the presence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity.
Understanding and accounting for this pattern in volatility is essential
for risk management and forecasting. Hence, we will remodel the
residuals.

```{r}
stock_difret = na.omit(diff(stk_ret_sq))

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
stk_ret_arch_test1 = ArchTest(stock_difret, lags = 10) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test1 # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)
```

**Implication:** The results from above test suggest the variation and
the presence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the
remodeled residual. Hence,we proceed with Residual modelling assuming
Heteroskedasticity.

```{r}
# GARCH Model
garch_model1 = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0,0), include.mean = TRUE))
nse_ret_garch1 = ugarchfit(garch_model1, data = stock_difret); nse_ret_garch1

garch_model2 = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1,5), include.mean = FALSE))
nse_ret_garch2 = ugarchfit(garch_model2, data = stock_difret); nse_ret_garch2

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
gar_resd = residuals(nse_ret_garch2)^2
stk_ret_arch_test1 = ArchTest(gar_resd, lags = 10) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test1 # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)
```

**Objective:** The objective was to fit GARCH models to the residuals of
the ARIMA(1, 1, 5) mean model and evaluate volatility clustering.

**Analysis:** Two GARCH models ('garch_model1' and 'garch_model2') were
fitted to the residuals, and an ARCH test was conducted on squared
residuals to assess volatility clustering.

**Results:**

Model Comparison: garch_model2 (sGARCH(1,1) with ARFIMA(1,0,5) mean
model) appears to be superior to garch_model1 (sGARCH(1,1) with
ARFIMA(0,0,0) mean model) based on the following:

Higher LogLikelihood: garch_model2 has a higher LogLikelihood value
(5942.139) compared to garch_model1 (5757.262), indicating a better fit
to the data.

Lower Information Criteria: All information criteria (Akaike, Bayes,
Shibata, Hannan-Quinn) are lower for garch_model2 compared to
garch_model1, suggesting a better fit.

Ljung-Box Tests: Both models exhibit significant serial correlation in
the standardized residuals and squared residuals, as indicated by the
p-values of the Ljung-Box tests.

ARCH LM Tests: The ARCH LM test for garch_model2 yields a chi-squared
statistic of 0.034814 with 10 degrees of freedom, resulting in a p-value
of 1. This indicates no significant evidence of ARCH effects in
garch_model2. Similarly, for garch_model1, the ARCH LM test did not show
significant ARCH effects.

Nyblom Stability Test: Both models pass the Nyblom stability test, with
all individual statistics below the critical values.

Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test: Both models exhibit a significant
p-value for the test statistic, indicating poor goodness-of-fit.

Therefore, considering the higher LogLikelihood, lower information
criteria, and the absence of significant ARCH effects in both models,
garch_model2 (sGARCH(1,1) with ARFIMA(1,0,5) mean model) can be
considered a better fit for the data compared to garch_model1.

Further analysis will be required to address the significant serial
correlation observed in the standardized residuals and squared
residuals.

```{r}
garch_modelf = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1,5), include.mean = FALSE))
stk_ret_garch = ugarchfit(garch_modelf, data = stock_ret); stk_ret_garch
```

**Objective:** The aim was to fit a GARCH model to the stock returns and
evaluate its goodness-of-fit using the Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit
Test.

**Analysis:** Utilized the 'ugarchspec' and 'ugarchfit' functions to fit
a GARCH model to the stock returns. The model employed was an
sGARCH(1,1) with a mean model of ARFIMA(1,0,5). The Adjusted Pearson
Goodness-of-Fit Test was conducted for different group sizes (20, 30,
40, and 50), computing the test statistic and corresponding p-values.

**Result:**

GARCH Model: The fitted GARCH model is specified as sGARCH(1,1) with a
mean model of ARFIMA(1,0,5). Optimal parameters for the model were
estimated, with estimates and standard errors provided. Adjusted Pearson
Goodness-of-Fit Test: The test was performed for various group sizes,
and the resulting p-values were extremely low (e.g., 9.881e-17),
indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of a good fit.
Implications:

The Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test suggests that the fitted GARCH
model may not adequately capture the characteristics of the observed
daily returns of the asset. However, several considerations should be
taken into account:

Sample Size Sensitivity: The test's sensitivity to sample size can lead
to low p-values even with minor deviations from the expected
distribution.

Additional Diagnostic Tests: Other diagnostic tests, such as the
Weighted Ljung-Box Test on Standardized Residuals and Weighted ARCH LM
Tests, do not indicate significant serial correlation or ARCH effects,
suggesting that the model adequately addresses these aspects.

Interpretation Context: Interpretation should be contextualized within
the specific characteristics of the asset and the underlying assumptions
of the GARCH modeling framework. Conclusion:

**Actionable points**: While the Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test
raises concerns about the model's fit to the observed data, additional
analysis and consideration of alternative diagnostic tests are warranted
to make a comprehensive assessment of the model's adequacy. Further
investigation into model specification and potential sources of
discrepancy may be necessary for a more robust evaluation.

# GARCH Forecast
stk_ret_garch_forecast1 = ugarchforecast(stk_ret_garch, n.ahead = 100); stk_ret_garch_forecast1
```

**Objective:** To forecast volatility using the fitted GARCH model for
the next 100 time points. Analysis: Used the 'ugarchforecast' function
to generate volatility forecasts for the next 100 time points.

**Result:** GARCH Model Forecast: - Model: sGARCH - Horizon: 100 - Roll
Steps: 0 - Out of Sample: 0 0-roll forecast [T0=2022-03-30]: -
Forecasted Series: - T+1 to T+100: Contains forecasted values of
volatility (Sigma) for each time point.

**Implication:** The forecasted values represent the predicted
volatility for the next 100 time points based on the fitted GARCH model.
These forecasts can be useful for risk management and decision-making,
providing insights into the expected future volatility of the financial
time series.
